# ESMS

This version of ESMS aims to enhancing the latest available version of ESMS by Ely Bendersky (https://github.com/eliben/esms):

* replace TXT files with JSON
* allow for longer player names, with no need for normalisation (e.g.: no underscors for spaces)
* better generation of player names, possibly by using external libraries or APIs

It's also a playground for improving my C/C++ knowledge.

I'm not planning on changing anything of the original engine logic.
